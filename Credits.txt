Credits and Notes from the development team
-----------------------------------------------
 I act as project manager and part of the Development team, essentially, Scrum Master and Developer, where I was the one
 that came up with the idea to make a minecraft mod in the first place to accelerate the learning we all had in class.
 This choice was made as almost everyone on the development team was already interested in the game, as well as the fact
 that it was programmed in Java, with many resources available online for those of us who wanted to teach ourselves.
 However, I did not come up with the idea to create Emerald Armour, neither was Eros, as mods like this one have existed
 for a very large portion of this video games history. However, the original plan was to have everyone in the team vote
 on which mod they all most wanted to work on. This was ultimately scrapped, as we instead decided to do mods which
 would be small enough that we could get them done quickly with the right skills, but ones that we knew we did not have
 the skills to make in the first place. This was done with the intention of pushing up as much as possible while also
 retaining realistic deadlines. The person who originally suggested the idea of us doing the Emerald Armour mod is Eros
 Lorenzo, see his credits and notes below.

A mod in Minecraft that brings in actual use to the emeralds that are in the game aside from trading.
This was a mod made by myself, and some friends and I really just wanted to make emeralds more useful.
I always found it kind of disappointing how aside from trading they really could not be used for anything
other than trading. I intend to make emerald armor like the middle ground between iron armor and diamond
armor since there is a gap in the Minecraft tech tree between iron and diamond.
 - Eros Lorenzo (I suggested this idea, Original Author)

 This is a mod in Minecraft that allows players to use the emeralds that are collected in the game outside
 of trading. The mod was made by myself and a few friends of mine because we wanted to make emeralds a more
 useful item for players of the game.
