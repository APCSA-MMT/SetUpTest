Minecraft-EmeraldArmo(u)r mod
-----------------------------------------------
A mod in Minecraft that brings in actual use to the emeralds that are in the game aside from trading.
This was a mod made by myself, and some friends and I really just wanted to make emeralds more useful.
I always found it kind of disappointing how aside from trading they really could not be used for anything
other than trading. I intend to make emerald armor like the middle ground between iron armor and diamond
armor since there is a gap in the Minecraft tech tree between iron and diamond.

 This is a mod in Minecraft that allows players to use the emeralds that are collected in the game outside
 of trading. The mod was made by myself and a few of friends because we just wanted to make emeralds more
 useful for players of the game.
